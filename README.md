## Insights and Recommendations:

### **Balanced Payment Options:**
With an even distribution of payment methods, it’s clear that customers appreciate the variety of options. However, there could be opportunities to promote e-wallets or credit card payments by offering loyalty points or incentives to increase convenience and cashless transactions.

### **Declining Cost of Goods:**
The sharp decrease in the cost of goods after March could be due to better supplier negotiations, reduced production costs, or seasonal variations. It's essential to monitor if these reductions are sustainable long-term and whether they translate to improved profitability.

### **Revenue by Product Category:**
Home and lifestyle and food and beverages categories are generating significant revenue. The business could consider expanding or promoting these categories further, while also exploring why certain categories like electronic accessories or health and beauty are contributing comparatively lower revenue.

### **Customer Experience:**
With an average rating of 6.98, there’s room to enhance the customer experience. Efforts in customer service improvements, product quality, or post-purchase support could help increase satisfaction and ratings, possibly leading to higher sales.

### **Sales by Region:**
The ability to filter by branch and city is essential for regional analysis. The business should assess which regions or branches are underperforming and implement targeted sales strategies or promotions accordingly.
